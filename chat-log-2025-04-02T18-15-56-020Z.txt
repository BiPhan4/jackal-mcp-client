User Query: Send a text file
Assistant Response:
I can help you save a text file, but I need two pieces of information:

1. What content would you like to save in the file?
2. What should the filename be?

Please provide both the content and desired filename, and I'll help you save the text file.

-------------------

User Query:  should be   sample text, and the content should just be higher. My name must be, and I am 31 years old today.
