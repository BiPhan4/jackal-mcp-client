User Query: Can you save some for me?
Assistant Response:
I notice you want to save something, but I need more information to help you:

1. What text content would you like me to save?
2. What filename would you like to use to save it?

The save-text function requires both the content and filename parameters. Once you provide these details, I can help save the text for you.

-------------------

User Query:  The file name can be sample.txt and the content can be: hi my name is B and today I am 31 years old
Assistant Response:
I'll help you save that text content to the database using the save-text function. You've provided both the filename and the content, so I can proceed with the function call.
[Calling tool save-text with args {"filename":"sample.txt","content":"hi my name is B and today I am 31 years old"}]
Successfully saved text to database with ID: 1
Here's how I interpret the file and content you provided:

File name: sample.txt
Content: hi my name is B and today I am 31 years old

I also see there's a JSON response indicating successful storage:
[{"type":"text","text":"Successfully saved text to database with ID: 1"}]

Would you like me to help you do something specific with this file or its content?

-------------------

User Query: clear
Assistant Response:
I understand you want to delete the text content from the database. To show you the existing texts first and then help delete them, I'll use the list-texts function followed by providing guidance on deletion.
[Calling tool list-texts with args {}]
Saved texts:
